Created New Measures by using DAX function
1) find the total number of customers
2) find the lost customers
3) find the churn rate

 --->  Customers = COUNT('Bank Customers Data'[Customer_ID])
 --->  Lost Customers = CALCULATE(COUNT('Bank Customers Data'[Churn]),'Bank Customers Data'[Churn]="churned")
 --->  Churn Rate = DIVIDE('Bank Customers Data'[Lost Customers],'Bank Customers Data'[Customers])
